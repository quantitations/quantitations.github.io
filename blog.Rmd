MAKE my Q the favicon - needs to be set in an html header - is that working?


I blog about mathematics, data science, productivity, and whatever else I'm thinking about.


NOW Use R to create a list of the posts and make links to them.



FIRST: PROOF OF CONCEPT - make sure I can make R create html file that behave nicely when linked from this page.
