Exercise 1.42 - First sentence of solution. "projection of onto" should have been "projection of y onto"

Exercise 3.1 - "no greater than" should have been "at least as large as" - hopefully a confused reader would look at the solution in the back and realize that the question was stated incorrectly!

Some exercise labels were printed in green but should have been colored blue:
1.6
1.9
1.17
1.18
1.58
