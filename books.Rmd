*[Data Analysis with R: The Big Picture](static/books/big-picture.pdf)* - A gentle and systematic introduction for complete beginners. This book is almost finished, and I've used it for courses. It may eventually be expanded into a more computational and up-to-date textbook called *Data Science Workflow with R and the tidyverse*.


*[Visualizing Linear Models](static/books/Visualizing-Linear-Models.pdf)* - This short textbook introduces the theory of linear models, emphisizing two important and complementary ways of visualizing the concepts: the *observations* picture and the *variables* picture.


*Visualizing Random Vectors* - This will be a follow-up to *Visualizing Linear Models* that encourages the student to extend the two-pictures idea to random vectors more generally by understanding $L^2$ spaces using intuition from Euclidean space.


*A Systematic Guide to Mathematical Statistics* - This is a long-term project, but early drafts of some sections are posted below.
