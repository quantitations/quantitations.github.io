title: "Research"

I've worked on a variety of topics, but moving forward I'm primarily interested in:

- adaptive estimation
- simulated annealing
- general applied statistics and machine learning
- unifying and efficiently organizing mathematical statistical knowledge
- revealing visual or intuitive ways of understanding concepts
